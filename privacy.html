            <h1>1. End Customer License Agreement</h1><br><br>
            <p>This End Customer License Agreement (“License Agreement”) was executed, signed and took effect on Customer’s execution (“Effective Date”) by and between Najam Tech AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 530 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10036 (“Najam Tech AI”) and Customer identified in the Statement of Work (“Customer”).</p>
            <p>Customer and Najam Tech AI shall be hereinafter individually referred to as “Party” and collectively as “Parties”.</p>
            <p>If the Customer acquires Services (as defined below) under the terms specified herein through a Partner (as defined below), this License Agreement will take precedence over any conflicting terms in the agreement between the Customer and the Partner, insofar as the relationship between the Customer and Najam Tech AI is concerned. Rights granted to the Customer in a separate agreement with the Partner, which are absent in this License Agreement, are applicable exclusively in the context of that Partner. Consequently, the Customer is obliged to pursue any remedies or enforcement of such rights solely with the Partner and not Najam Tech AI.</p>
            <p>BY SIGNING A STATEMENT OF WORK, ACCESSING, RECEIVING, AND/OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT MAY YOU ACCESS, RECEIVE OR OTHERWISE USE ANY NAJAM TECH AI PRODUCT OR SERVICE WITHOUT AGREEING TO THESE TERMS (OR ANOTHER AGREEMENT AGREED TO IN WRITING BY NAJAM TECH AI).</p>

            <p>3. <span> “Customer” </span>means the Customer identified in the SOW.</p>
            <p>4. <span>  “Customer Data”</span> refers to any data or images submitted, uploaded, imported, integrated, or otherwise communicated by Customer to Najam Tech AI.</p>
            <p>5. <span>  “Facility”</span> means the sites/facilities/plants of the Customer in which Services are to be used by Customer.</p>

            <p>7. <span> “License Agreement”</span>  refers collectively to this End Customer License Agreement and any attachments hereto.</p>
            <p>8. <span> “Partner” </span> refers to a Najam Tech AI-authorized partner, reseller, distributor, or marketplace.</p>

            <p>13. <span> “Subscription” </span>refers to a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable right to use the Services and the output of the Services in accordance with this License Agreement and the Statement of Work (SOW) within the Customer’s relevant facilities, as detailed in the SOW. </p>
            <p>14. <span> “Subscription Start Date”</span>  refers to the date on which the Services commence, as specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
            <p>15. <span>  “Subscription Term”</span> refers to the initial term during which the Services can be used in a Facility, as outlined in this License Agreement and specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

In the event that any provision of this License Agreement is deemed to conflict with a provision of a SOW or other agreement between Customer and Partner regarding the Services or other subject matter of this License Agreement, the provision of this License Agreement shall apply for Customer and Najam Tech AI, unless Najam Tech AI and Customer agree otherwise in writing.</p><br><br>
            <h2>2. SUBJECT</h2>
            <p>This License Agreement sets out the principles regarding the provision of services detailed in the related Statement of Work (SOW) via the Service Software (“Services”) to the Customer by Najam Tech AI, as well as the rights and obligations of the Parties in this regard.</p><br><br>
            <h2>3. TERM</h2>
            <p>This License Agreement enters into force on the Effective Date and remains in effect until the expiration of the last Subscription Term in all active Statements of Work (SOWs) issued under this License Agreement (“Term of the License Agreement”). The term of the Services will commence on the Subscription Start Date set forth in the SOW and shall continue for the Subscription Term identified therein, along with any renewal thereof, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of this License Agreement.</p><br><br>
            <h2>4. LICENSE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
            <p><span> 4.1. License Agreement</span> Najam Tech AI hereby grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable, worldwide license to access and utilize the Services pursuant to the terms of this License Agreement and the applicable Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
            <p><span> 4.2. Reservation of Rights</span> Najam Tech AI and its licensors own and retain all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Service Software, Services, and Service Data (collectively “Najam Tech AI Intellectual Property”), including any improvements, modifications, and enhancements. Najam Tech AI expends significant resources gathering, assembling, and compiling the Service Data, and such Service Data constitutes an original compilation protected by applicable copyright laws. Except for the rights expressly granted in this License Agreement, Customer shall acquire no other rights, express or implied, in or to the Najam Tech AI Intellectual Property, and all rights not expressly provided to Customer hereunder are reserved by Najam Tech AI and its licensors. If Customer chooses, in its sole discretion, to provide Feedback (defined below) to Najam Tech AI, nothing in this License Agreement or in the parties’ dealings arising out of or related to this License Agreement will restrict Najam Tech AI’s right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, or otherwise exploit Feedback, without compensating or crediting Customer or the individual providing such Feedback. Customer’s Confidential Information shall not include Feedback, to the extent that such Feedback relates exclusively to Najam Tech AI’s products or services. “Feedback” means any feedback (e.g., questions, comments, suggestions, or the like), whether orally or in writing, regarding any of the Services.</p>
