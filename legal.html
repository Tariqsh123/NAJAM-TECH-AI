            <p>14. <span> “Subscription Start Date”</span>  refers to the date on which the Services commence, as specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
            <p>15. <span>  “Subscription Term”</span> refers to the initial term during which the Services can be used in a Facility, as outlined in this License Agreement and specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

            <h2>3. TERM</h2>
            <p>Here’s a refined version of your text with "Intenseye" replaced by "Najam Tech AI": This License Agreement enters into force on the Effective Date and remains in effect until the expiration of the last Subscription Term in all active Statements of Work (SOWs) issued under this License Agreement (“Term of the License Agreement”). The term of the Services will commence on the Subscription Start Date set forth in the SOW and shall continue for the Subscription Term identified therein, along with any renewal thereof, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of this License Agreement.</p><br><br>

Reservation of Rights</span> Najam Tech AI and its licensors own and retain all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Service Software, Services, and Service Data (collectively “Najam Tech AI Intellectual Property”), including any improvements, modifications, and enhancements. Najam Tech AI expends significant resources gathering, assembling, and compiling the Service Data, and such Service Data constitutes an original compilation protected by applicable copyright laws. Except for the rights expressly granted in this License Agreement, Customer shall acquire no other rights, express or implied, in or to the Najam Tech AI Intellectual Property, and all rights not expressly provided to Customer hereunder are reserved by Najam Tech AI and its licensors. If Customer chooses, in its sole discretion, to provide Feedback (defined below) to Najam Tech AI, nothing in this License Agreement or in the parties’ dealings arising out of or related to this License Agreement will restrict Najam Tech AI’s right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, or otherwise exploit Feedback, without compensating or crediting Customer or the individual providing such Feedback. Customer’s Confidential Information shall not include Feedback, to the extent that such Feedback relates exclusively to Najam Tech AI’s products or services. “Feedback” means any feedback (e.g., questions, comments, suggestions, or the like), whether orally or in writing, regarding any of the Services.</p>
            <p><span> 4.3. Use Restrictions</span> Customer will not, directly or indirectly, alter or modify the Services and Service Software, or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant to the Services, Service Software, or any software, documentation, or data related to the Services.

            <p><span> 7.1</span>The Parties must comply with applicable personal data protection laws regarding any personal data that they have learned, accessed, and transferred to each other in connection with the performance of this License Agreement, without limitation to this Section.</p>
            <p><span> 7.2</span>Customer acts as the data controller for the performance of the Services and for any personal data processing activities carried out in connection with it.</p>
            <p><span> 7.3</span>For purposes of this License Agreement, Najam Tech AI operates as the data processor under the direction of the Customer, who acts as the data controller. Customer has full control and discretion over its personal data submitted to Najam Tech AI. </p>
            <p><span> 7.4</span>  Within the scope of the Services provided by Najam Tech AI under this License Agreement, if necessary, Najam Tech AI, as a data processor, will only process personal data provided by the data controller, Customer, for the purpose of performing the Services. Najam Tech AI will not process personal data for any purpose other than the performance of the License Agreement, nor share it with third parties, or use it for advertising, sales, or similar purposes.</p>
            <p><span> 7.5</span>  Najam Tech AI will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the personal data under this License Agreement. Taking into account the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of data processing, as well as any potential risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, these measures include: (a) the encryption of personal data; (b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services; (c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing of personal data. In assessing the appropriate level of security, Najam Tech AI shall take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing personal data, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of data subjects and the risks presented by the processing of personal data, particularly from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.</p>
            <p><span> 7.6</span> Najam Tech AI shall notify Customer without undue delay, and in any event no later than seventy-two (72) hours, upon becoming aware of a personal data breach affecting personal data, providing Customer with sufficient information to allow Customer to meet its obligations to report or inform data subjects of the personal data breach under applicable data protection laws. Najam Tech AI shall cooperate with Customer and take such reasonable commercial steps to assist in the investigation, mitigation, and remediation of a personal data breach.</p><br><br>
            <h2>8. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE</h2><br>
            <p><span> 8.1</span> In providing the Services under this License Agreement, each Party may have access to the other Party’s confidential and proprietary information (“Confidential Information”). To the extent such Confidential Information is disclosed to the Parties, the Party receiving the Confidential Information (“Receiving Party”) shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party for any reason without the prior written consent of the Party disclosing the Confidential Information (“Disclosing Party”), except to its employees or agents who have a need to know such information for the performance of this License Agreement. </p>
            <p><span> 8.2 </span>  In the event the Receiving Party is requested or required by legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, if legally permitted, give the Disclosing Party prompt notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief prior to any such disclosure. If such protective order is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that its legal counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed and shall work with the Disclosing Party to minimize the extent and effect of such disclosure.</p>
            <p><span> 8.3</span>Both parties understand and agree that monetary damages will not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of the Receiving Party’s confidentiality obligations under this Section and that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctions and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach for the Disclosing Party but will be in addition to all other remedies available to the Disclosing Party at law or in equity.</p><br><br>
            <h2>9. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h2><br>
            <p><span> 9.1</span>Mutual Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants that: (i) each Party is a business duly incorporated and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation; (ii) each Party has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under this License Agreement; (iii) each Party shall comply with all international, federal, or state laws or regulations applicable to the performance of its obligations under this License Agreement; (iv) Services may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Each Party represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. Customer shall not permit access to or use of any Services in a U.S. embargoed country or in violation of any other applicable export laws or regulations.</p>
            <p><span> 9.2</span> Najam Tech AI Representations and Warranties.

Najam Tech AI shall perform the technical support services in compliance with the specifics of each technical issue and does not guarantee any solution regarding any technical issue.</p>
            <p><span> 9.3 </span>  Customer Representations and Warranties. Customer represents and warrants that: (a) its use of the Service, including any Customer Data provided by Customer for use with the Service or handling by Najam Tech AI, will: (i) comply with any applicable law or regulation, (ii) not cause a breach of any agreement with or rights of any third party (including, without limitation, the rules of any social network platform or any data subject rights), and (iii) not unreasonably interfere with the use of services offered by Najam Tech AI to third parties; and (b) it shall use the Service strictly in accordance with this License Agreement and other written instructions (e.g., product documentation, release notes, mutually agreed SOWs, etc.) provided by Najam Tech AI.</p><br><br>
